            <p style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
                Hi! I'm Sahil, a DevOps Engineer who loves automating the boring stuff, making cloud magic, and finding the fun in tech. I believe in the power of a good meme, a strong coffee, and a well-timed script.<br><br>
                <b>Education:</b> Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology (and a PhD in Googling!)
            </p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <ul style="text-align:left; max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;">
                <li><b>DevOps Engineer:</b> Automated all the things, made the cloud safer, and built tools so I could spend more time on Stack Overflow.</li>
                <li><b>Technical Support Engineer:</b> Helped people, fixed stuff, and made sure the WiFi was always working (you're welcome!).</li>
                <li><b>IT Support Technician:</b> Kept servers happy, networks running, and printers (mostly) under control.</li>
                <li><b>Monitoring Centre Operator:</b> Watched the blinking lights, responded to alerts, and kept calm during chaos.</li>
